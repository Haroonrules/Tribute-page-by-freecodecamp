        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p class="text__bio">
          Riki Nendou is a dutiful and dull-witted boy. He likes helping people and prioritizing the weak.

          Riki is evil in appearance and sloppy in behavior, and thus avoided by his classmates. His defining physical
          attribute is the scar on his left eye, something that can be used to differentiate between him, his father and
          mother, who all have the same faces. His hair is cut in a weird way with his bangs colored yellow while the
          rest is black. In school, he wears the standard PK Academy uniform but keeps his uniform open showing a
          t-shirt. Outside school he mostly wears collared shirts. He has a mustache , which he originally grew to match
          his favorite comic book villain, Baron Cola.

        <h3>Personality</h3>
        <p class="text__personality">Riki's dominant traits are his apparent lack of intelligence and the scar on his
          left eye. Because of his looks, he is sometimes interpreted as a bad guy. He can be considered as a very
          strong young man as he can easily defeat Hairo in every aspect of physical activities and sports.[5] Riki is
          the only person Saiki Kusuo cannot the read thoughts of. Because of that, he is usually an idiot with bad
          manners and typically needs things to be explained to him countless times, but he still cannot understand it.
          However, despite his villainous face and actions, Riki is a kind man.</p>
